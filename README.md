# Tea Taster

An application for storing tea tasting notes. This application is the output of the three day Ionic Framework Enterprise training. It is also used as the starting point for some of our other prorduct demos such as the demos for Identity Vault and Auth Connect.

## Building

If you would like to build this application yourself, do the following:

- Clone this repo
- `cd tea-taster`
- `npm i`
- `npm run build`
- `ionic cap sync`

At this point, you should be able to either run the application in a dev server via `ionic start` or on a device using `ionic cap open ios` (or `android`).
